# GPU Optimization Using SGEMM Kernal Performance Dataset
*************************************************************************************************************

### Objective
This repository explores the possible opputunities to improve GPU performance without specifying model types using SGEMM GPU kernel performance Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Dataset
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SGEMM+GPU+kernel+performance]

> This data set measures the running time of a matrix-matrix product A*B = C, where all matrices have size 2048 x 2048, \
> using a parameterizable SGEMM GPU kernel with 241600 possible parameter combinations. For each tested combination, 
> 4 runs were performed and their results are reported as the 4 last columns. All times are measured in milliseconds*. 


### Methods
1. Clustering
2. Classification/Regression
3. Time series

### Conclusion
